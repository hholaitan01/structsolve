---

## ✨ Features

### 🔩 Beam Analysis
- Continuous beams with any number of spans and support types (Fixed, Pinned, Roller)
- Loads: Full UDL, Partial UDL, UVL (triangular), Point loads
- Support settlements and prescribed rotations
- Full **Slope Deflection Method** workings — step by step
- SFD & BMD diagrams
- RC design integration (analyse then design in one click)

### 🏛️ Frame Analysis *(General Solver — v4.0)*
- **Any plane frame topology** — portal, L-shape, T-shape, multi-bay, multi-storey, propped cantilever
- Any number of nodes and members
- Support types: Fixed, Pinned, Roller, Free (cantilever tip)
- **Applied joint moments** (e.g. 150 kNm at C)
- **Support settlements** at any node (vertical & horizontal)
- **Modified stiffness** — auto-detects far-end pinned/roller members and applies 3EI/L
- **Automatic sway group detection** — single and multi-storey
- Full 6-step workings: FEMs → SD equations → equilibrium matrix → solution → back-substitution → check
- BMD overlay diagram
- 6 built-in quick templates

### 🧱 RC Beam Design (BS 8110)

## 📐 Theory

All structural analysis uses the **Slope Deflection Method**:

```
M_ij = M_Fij + (2EI/L)[2θᵢ + θⱼ − 3ψ]
```

Where:
- `M_Fij` = Fixed-end moment
- `EI/L` = member stiffness
- `θᵢ, θⱼ` = joint rotations (unknowns)
- `ψ = Δ/L` = chord rotation from sway or settlement

RC design follows **BS 8110-1:1997**:
- Flexure: `K = M/(fcu·b·d²)`, `z = d[0.5 + √(0.25 − K/0.9)]`
- Shear: `v = V/(b·d)` vs `vc` from Table 3.8
- Deflection: basic span/depth ratio × modification factor
